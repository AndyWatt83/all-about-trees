# all-about-trees
Going over the various nuances in working with trees and interacting with hierarchical data.
And also a reminder for myself about some other data structures, such as linked lists.
And perhaps eventually a reminder also about some of the important algorithms that I've not looked at since uni days...

This is all just academic. Most / all of these things are implemented already in .NET. This is just an exercise to remind myself of how all of the basics stuff actually works. And, a good exuse to play around with .NET core, and use Visual Studio Code for some C# development.
